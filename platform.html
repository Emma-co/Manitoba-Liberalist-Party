            <p><b>Dear Fellow Manitobans,</b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we tired of the insufficient medical personnel in our hospitals? Long waiting times at the hospitals that has been
              a source of frustration for us, wasting everyone's time? Are we tired of the high rates of stabbing and criminal activities in our city?
              We are raising tax rates to 19% so that you do not have to wait more than 3 hours at the hospital only to get checked. 
              With two extra ERs in Winnipeg and one in each minor city, anybody in Manitoba can get the care they require. 
              We will also need to employ 300 new physicians and 500 new nurses to manage all these new hospitals.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are still not safe on our streets. Gang violence and mogging/stabbing are two of the most widespread crimes in our province, and we have plans 
                  to eliminate them. We will include mandatory minimum punishment, which restricts judicial discretion and adds to jail congestion. 
                  Prosecutorial discretion may lead to uneven treatment of defendants. </p>
          </div>
          <div id="part2">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also going to provide electric charging stations available to Manitobans and increase the use of eco-friendly cars to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to fight global warming.</p> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to unemployment, and illiteracy. Indigenous peoples frequently score top. They experience greater rates of internal displacement, hunger, poverty, and landlessness in our province, 
                  to counter this we will make homeless shelters so they at least have a home and within these homes It would include food, so they don’t starve. To ensure that 
                  indigenous children receive the education they deserve.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use the reserves to construct more libraries, increase funding for schools, and hire more qualified teachers. 
                  As a result of these improvements, more indigenous will be qualified for jobs, which will help to combat the unemployment that the indigenous community faces. 
                  Join us as we advance Manitoba.</p>
